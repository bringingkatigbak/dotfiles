# Dotfiles

A fork of twerth/dotfiles

## File and directory structure

The *dotfiles* directory can be stored anywhere; simply run install.sh to symbolically-link all of the relevant files into your home directory!

## Caveat emptor          

These files are generally used primarily on OS X, and are not particularly well-tested on Linux, so if you plan on using it there, be careful!

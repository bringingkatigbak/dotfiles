A few of my . files (mainly vim files).  Warning: I mod these all the time, and sometimes I break stuff.

Note: I store all my command-line files in a folder (cl/bin cl/etc cl/doc), to keep them organized away from all my other files.  I link them to the root of my home folder, so I prefer to store them without the . (gitignore rather than .gitignore), then I add the dot in the link.  So if you use one, make sure you put the dot back.

Also, my main platforms are OS X and Linux (Debian based) in the console, not XWindows.  Most of my stuff works just fine in something like gnome-terminal, but I usually only check my main platforms when I make changes.
